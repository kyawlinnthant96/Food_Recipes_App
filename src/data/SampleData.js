      "Heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a large saucepan over a medium-high heat and add the beef. Fry for 20 minutes, turning the cubes from time to time so they don’t stick to the pan. Juices will seep out but these will reduce down and the meat will brown.Meanwhile, add the base ingredients along with 1 tablespoon of water to a blender or food processor.\n\n Blitz to a rough paste.Transfer the meat from the pan to a dish and set aside. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons of oil to the pan used to brown the beef. Heat over a medium-high heat and add the onion-tomato paste. \n\nAdd the seasonings, stir and then fry for 5 minutes until fragrant. Add the beef and 1.5 litres of water and cover the pan with a lid. Turn the heat down to medium-low and cook for 2½ hours until the beef is tender and falling apart, stirring occasionally to stop the curry from sticking to the base of the pan.When it's ready, serve the curry with steamed rice, any of the soups and a vegetable dish or salad to balance the richness. It also goes well with Indian breads, such as naan, puri and paratha.",

      'Wash the pork belly under cold running water, then transfer to a large stockpot and cover with water that’s been lightly seasoned with salt. Bring to the boil, then drain and wash the pork belly and stockpot of any scum. Repeat this coldblanching process once more, then set the washed pork belly aside. This will remove impurities from the meat, giving you a clear final sauce and reducing the cooking time. If you prefer to skip this step, that’s fine; as mentioned, the cook time will be longer and the final broth will be cloudy, but the finished dish will be equally delicious.\nIn a pestle and mortar, pound the coriander root, garlic, peppercorns and 1 teaspoon of salt to a coarse paste. Heat the pork fat in a wok or heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat. Add the paste and fry for 3–5 minutes until aromatic and fragrant, then add the blanched pork belly and begin to sear and lightly colour the meat all over, stirring all the while to prevent the meat from catching and burning.\nAdd the sugar, black soy sauce, star anise, cassia bark, cardamom pods and bay leaves. Allow the sugar to melt and caramelise with the pork belly; it should stick and cling to the meat. Stir to evenly coat all the meat with the caramel.\nAdd the stock, then season with the light soy sauce. Add the dried mandarin peel and knotted pandan leaf, if using. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 2–3 hours until the pork belly is tender but holds its shape with a slight bounce, topping up the pan with extra stock or water as required during the cooking time to keep the meat covered.\n Increase the heat and cook for another 10–15 minutes to reduce the braising liquor by half so that it’s thick and glossy and coats the meat. Be sure to stir the meat during this step so that it doesn’t catch and burn on the base of the pan. The desired consistency should coat the back of a spoon, and it should taste sweet and savoury with a peppery finish. Top with snipped coriander sprigs and serve.',

Cool to room temperature and then pulverize in a clean coffee grinder.To make the broth, select a large wide pot that will fit the catfish comfortably with room to spare. (An 8-quart pot works well.) Add the water, lemongrass, ginger, bay leaves, black and white pepper, and salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.Carefully lower the fish into the pot. The fish may not be completely covered in water, but that’s okay. Bring the pot to a brisk simmer, lower the heat, and cook gently for 15 minutes. Using tongs, carefully turn the fish over or at least rotate it slightly to cook the side that was sticking out of the water. Simmer for another 5 minutes or until the fish flesh pulls away cleanly from the bone. Using tongs and a spider or slotted spoon, lift the fish out of the broth and transfer to a bowl. Turn off the heat and let the broth sit on the stove....',
